/// A specialized interface for a fully-featured **Distributed Resource Management System**.
///
/// This trait is designed for **Grid Resource Management Systems (GRMS)** and adapters
/// connecting to local resource management systems. It extends basic reservation logic
/// by introducing **Shadow Schedules** and a sophisticated **Three-Level Commitment** model.
///
/// ### The Three Levels of Commitment
///
/// In a distributed Grid environment, managing resource state requires a clear lifecycle:
/// 1. **Probe**: A non-binding inquiry to discover possible resource configurations.
/// 2. **Reserve**: A preliminary commitment. The system guarantees resource availability
///    for a specific **Commit Timeout** period. Also is the Deletion of reservation
///    without additional cost is possible.
/// 3. **Commit**: The final handshake. Both the requester and the resource provider
///    fix the reservation parameters.
/// 4. **Delete**: Cancels a reservation. This is free during the "Reserved" state but
///    may impose penalties if the reservation was already "Committed."
///
/// ### Shadow Schedules
/// This interface allows operations to be performed against a "Shadow Schedule" a sandbox
/// environment used to simulate scheduling changes without affecting the live production
/// resource flow.
