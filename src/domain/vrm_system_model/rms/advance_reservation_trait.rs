/// Direct interface to a local Resource Management System (RMS) capable of making advance reservations.
///
/// This trait serves as the bridge between the high-level Virtual Resource Manager (VRM) and the
/// underlying local RMS. It facilitates the core reservation lifecycle: **Probe**, **Reserve**, and **Commit**.
///
/// # Core Functions:
/// 1.  **[probe](Self::probe)**: Queries the RMS for available reservation candidates based on constraints.
///     This operation is read-only and does not reserve resources.
/// 2.  **[reserve](Self::reserve)**: Temporarily reserves a job. This submits the request to the real RMS
///     but marks it as temporarily.
/// 3.  **[commit](Self::commit)**: Finalizes the reservation. Once committed, the reservation is fixed
///     and should not be cancelled via `delete_task` during normal operation.
/// 4.  **[delete_task](Self::delete_task)**: Cancels a reservation. This typically occurs after
///     `reserve` but before `commit`, or if the user explicitly cancels a job.
///
/// # Shadow Schedules
/// This interface supports **Shadow Schedules** isolated copies of the actual booking schedule.
/// Operations performed on a shadow schedule (identified by a [`ShadowScheduleId`]) do not affect
/// the live RMS until [commit_shadow_schedule](Self::commit_shadow_schedule) is called. This is critical
/// for distributed transactions and "what-if" planning phases in the Grid/VRM system.
